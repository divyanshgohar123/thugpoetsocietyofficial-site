    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Thug Poet Society is more than just a music label — it's a movement that bridges raw street energy with lyrical depth. Born from the underground and built on truth, rhythm, and resistance, we champion voices that challenge norms and speak unapologetically.

From boom bap to trap, conscious rap to experimental flows — we honor the roots of hip hop while pushing its boundaries. Our roster is a collective of storytellers, beatmakers, and boundary-breakers who live and breathe the culture.

At Thug Poet Society, every bar is a statement, every track is a reflection, and every release is a revolution.

<h2>ONLY B</h2>
<p>ONLY B is a rising voice from the streets to the studio, representing the true spirit of hustle and dreams. His journey into music didn’t start with a mic, but with moves. As a kid, he was passionate about dance, and the beats of dance tracks always gave him a different kind of high. That early connection with rhythm slowly evolved into something deeper — a love for Hip-Hop.

Fuelled by passion and driven by dreams, he convinced his family to get him his first laptop. From that day, locked inside a small room, he started creating his own world — making beats, writing his own rap, and recording his own tracks. No guidance, no big studio, just pure hunger and self-learning.

Today, ONLY B writes his own songs, crafts his own sound, and tells his own story — one that speaks for every dreamer fighting to turn their bedroom into a stage and their thoughts into music. His vibe? Raw, real, and unapologetically authentic. His music isn’t just about bars — it’s about life, hustle, and self-belief.


From dance floors to rap flows — this is just the beginning.</p>
